ICAR SOIL HEALTH AND FERTILIZER GUIDELINES
=========================================
Source: Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi

1. NITROGEN (N) MANAGEMENT
---------------------------
Recommended N levels in soil: 280–560 kg/ha (Optimal)
Low: <280 kg/ha | Critical: <140 kg/ha | High: >560 kg/ha

Nitrogen Sources and Application Rates:
- Urea (46% N): 100–120 kg/ha for wheat; 120–150 kg/ha for rice
  Apply in 2–3 split doses: 50% basal + 25% at tillering + 25% at flag leaf
- DAP (18% N, 46% P): 100–130 kg/ha as basal dose
- Ammonium Sulphate (20.6% N): 200–250 kg/ha for acidic soils
- CAN (Calcium Ammonium Nitrate, 26% N): Best for heavy soils

Leaching Loss: N leaches at 0.8 kg/ha per mm of rainfall. Avoid urea
application before heavy rain (>20mm predicted).

Nitrogen Deficiency Symptoms:
- Yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis) from tip to base
- Stunted plant growth, pale green to yellow colouration
- Reduced tillering in wheat and rice

Cost Optimisation:
- If N > 560 kg/ha: Skip next urea dose (saves ₹450–₹500/acre)
- Use soil test before each season to avoid over-application
- Slow-release urea (neem-coated) reduces leaching by 15–20%

2. PHOSPHORUS (P) MANAGEMENT
------------------------------
Recommended P levels: 11–22 kg/ha (Optimal)
Low: <11 kg/ha | Critical: <5 kg/ha | High: >22 kg/ha

Phosphorus Sources:
- DAP (46% P₂O₅): 25–30 kg/ha as basal application
- SSP (16% P₂O₅): 60–80 kg/ha for P-deficient soils
- Rock Phosphate: Suitable for acidic soils (pH < 6.5)

Key Facts:
- P is immobile in soil; must be placed near root zone
- P fixation is high in: calcareous soils (pH>7.5) and acidic soils (pH<5.5)
- Apply P fertilisers 2–3 days before transplanting/sowing
- Mycorrhizal inoculants improve P uptake efficiency by 20–30%

P Deficiency Symptoms:
- Purpling/reddening of leaves (anthocyanin accumulation)
- Dark green foliage followed by bronze or olive discolouration
- Poor root development, delayed maturity

3. POTASSIUM (K) MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------
Recommended K levels: 110–280 kg/ha (Optimal)
Low: <110 kg/ha | Critical: <55 kg/ha | High: >280 kg/ha

Potassium Sources:
- MOP (Muriate of Potash, 60% K₂O): 20–30 kg/ha
- SOP (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K₂O): Preferred for chloride-sensitive crops
- Wood ash: 5–8 tonnes/ha (low analysis, organic source)

Key Facts:
- K improves disease resistance, drought tolerance, and grain quality
- Sandy soils are more prone to K leaching than clay soils
- Apply K in split: 50% basal + 50% at active growth stage

K Deficiency Symptoms:
- Scorching/browning of leaf tips and margins (leaf scorch)
- Weak stems, lodging in cereals
- Shrivelled, low-weight grains

4. ORGANIC CARBON (OC) AND SOIL HEALTH
----------------------------------------
Target OC: >0.75% for optimal crop productivity
Low: <0.5% (degraded soil) | Medium: 0.5–0.75% | High: >0.75%

FYM (Farm Yard Manure) Application:
- 10–12 tonnes FYM/ha before sowing
- N contribution: 0.5%, P: 0.2%, K: 0.5% of dry weight
- Improves soil structure, water retention, microbial activity

Vermicompost:
- 3–5 tonnes/ha as basal application
- Contains plant growth hormones and beneficial microbes

Green Manure:
- Dhaincha (Sesbania): Fixes 80–100 kg N/ha in 45–60 days
- Apply green manure 2–3 weeks before transplanting

5. pH MANAGEMENT
-----------------
Optimal range: 6.0–7.5
Acidic (<6.0): Apply agricultural lime — 2–4 tonnes/ha
Alkaline (>7.5): Apply gypsum (calcium sulphate) — 1–2 tonnes/ha
                 or sulphur at 200–300 kg/ha

6. MOISTURE AND IRRIGATION
---------------------------
Optimal soil moisture for wheat: 40–60%
Critical irrigation stages for wheat:
  1. Crown root initiation (20–25 DAS)
  2. Tillering (40–45 DAS)
  3. Jointing (60–65 DAS)
  4. Flowering (80–85 DAS)
  5. Grain filling (100–105 DAS)

Irrigation requirement: 400–450 mm total for wheat season
Each irrigation event: 50–75 mm (5–7 cm depth)
Avoid waterlogging: drains must empty field within 24 hours

7. FERTILIZER COST SAVINGS GUIDE
----------------------------------
| Scenario                        | Action           | Estimated Saving |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| N > 560 kg/ha                   | Skip Urea dose   | ₹450–500/acre   |
| P > 22 kg/ha                    | Skip DAP         | ₹280–320/acre   |
| K > 280 kg/ha                   | Skip MOP         | ₹180–200/acre   |
| OC > 0.75%, after FYM           | Reduce N by 20%  | ₹150–200/acre   |

8. CROP-SPECIFIC NPK REMOVAL (kg/ha per tonne of grain)
---------------------------------------------------------
| Crop   | N removal | P removal | K removal |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Wheat  | 20 kg/t   | 3.75 kg/t | 15 kg/t   |
| Rice   | 18 kg/t   | 4 kg/t    | 14 kg/t   |
| Maize  | 22 kg/t   | 4 kg/t    | 18 kg/t   |
| Cotton | 25 kg/t   | 5 kg/t    | 20 kg/t   |

9. INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT (INM)
-----------------------------------------
Principle: Combine organic + inorganic + biofertilisers for sustainability.
- Replace 20–25% chemical N with FYM or green manure
- Biofertilisers: Rhizobium (legumes), Azotobacter (cereals), PSB (P solubilising)
- Apply bio-fertilisers as seed treatment or soil drench

10. SOIL TEST-BASED FERTILIZER RECOMMENDATIONS (STBFR)
--------------------------------------------------------
Always conduct a soil test before each crop season.
