CROP NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY & MANAGEMENT RULES

1. NITROGEN (N) DEFICIENCY
   - Symptoms: V-shaped yellowing of lower leaves (Chlorosis), stunted growth.
   - Management: Top dressing with Urea. Foliar spray of 2% Urea if acute.
   - Crop Impact: Significant yield reduction in cereals (Wheat/Rice).

2. PHOSPHORUS (P) DEFICIENCY
   - Symptoms: Purple tint on leaves (Anthocyanin pigment), poor root development, delayed maturity.
   - Management: Apply DAP or SSP near the root zone.

3. POTASSIUM (K) DEFICIENCY
   - Symptoms: Scorching/burning of leaf margins which proceeds inwards (Marginal Necrosis). Weak stems (Lodging).
   - Management: Apply MOP.

4. SOIL MOISTURE MANAGEMENT
   - Saturation (>80%): Leads to root rot and nitrogen loss (denitrification). Stop Irrigation.
   - Stress (<30%): Wilting occurs. Yield penalty is high during flowering stage.
   - Optimal Range: 50% - 70% Field Capacity.

5. INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT (INM)
   - Organic Carbon: If OC < 0.5%, apply FYM (Farm Yard Manure) @ 10 tons/ha.
   - pH Standards: Ideal is 6.5 - 7.5. acidic soils (<6) need Lime; alkaline (>8) need Gypsum.
