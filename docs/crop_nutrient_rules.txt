1. WHEAT (Triticum aestivum)
-----------------------------
Season: Rabi (Oct/Nov sowing → Mar/Apr harvest)
NPK Recommendation (kg/ha):
  - Irrigated:      120:60:40 (N:P₂O₅:K₂O)
  - Rainfed:         80:40:30
  - High-yield var: 150:75:60

Growth Stages & Nutrient Needs:
  Week 0–2   Germination     P critical for root establishment
  Week 3–5   Tillering       N critical — apply 1st split N here
  Week 6–8   Jointing        N+K for stem strength
  Week 9–11  Heading         Balanced NPK for ear formation
  Week 12–14 Grain filling   K critical for grain weight
  Week 15–16 Maturity        Reduce irrigation, no fertilizer

N Application Schedule for Wheat:
  - 50% N as basal (at sowing with DAP)
  - 25% N at crown root initiation (CRI, 21 DAS)
  - 25% N at tillering (40–45 DAS)

Soil Health Targets for Wheat:
  - pH: 6.5–7.5 (optimal)
  - OC: >0.75%
  - N: 280–560 kg/ha
  - P: 15–25 kg/ha
  - K: 150–280 kg/ha
  - Moisture during grain fill: 45–55%

Yield Limiting Factors:
  1. Nitrogen deficiency: yellowing, stunted growth
  2. Late sowing (after Nov 25): yield penalty 30–35 kg/ha per day delay
  3. Waterlogging during tillering: 15–25% yield loss
  4. Powdery mildew (low N + high humidity): apply fungicide

2. RICE / PADDY (Oryza sativa)
--------------------------------
Season: Kharif (Jun/Jul transplant → Oct/Nov harvest)
NPK Recommendation (kg/ha):
  - High-yield HYV: 120:60:60
  - Traditional:     80:40:40
  - SRI method:      60:30:30 (with organic supplements)

N Application Schedule for Rice:
  - 1/3 N as basal (before transplanting)
  - 1/3 N at active tillering (15–20 DAT)
  - 1/3 N at panicle initiation (40–45 DAT)

Water Management:
  - Maintain 5 cm standing water during tillering
  - Drain for 7–10 days at mid-tillering (improves root aeration)
  - Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) saves 20–30% water

Zinc deficiency in rice:
  - Common in alkali soils (pH > 8)
  - Symptoms: brown rusty spots, khaira disease
  - Cure: ZnSO₄ at 25 kg/ha as basal or foliar spray (0.5%)

3. MAIZE (Zea mays)
---------------------
Season: Kharif / Spring
NPK Recommendation: 120:60:60 kg/ha

N Application for Maize:
  - 30% as basal + 40% at knee-high + 30% at tasselling
  - Side-dress urea at V6 stage for best efficiency
  
Key Micronutrients:
  - Zinc: 25 kg ZnSO₄/ha for deficient soils
  - Boron: 1 kg/ha for silking support

4. SUGARCANE (Saccharum officinarum)
--------------------------------------
Season: Planted Oct/Nov (plant crop) or ratoon
NPK Recommendation:
  - Plant crop:  250:85:120 kg/ha
  - Ratoon crop: 200:65:100 kg/ha

Apply N in 3–4 splits over the season.
Trash mulching reduces N requirement by 15–20%.

5. COTTON (Gossypium hirsutum)
--------------------------------
NPK Recommendation: 150:75:75 kg/ha for Bt Cotton
Critical Stages:
  - Squaring (45–50 DAS): N+K boost for boll retention
  - Boll development (70–90 DAS): K for fibre quality

6. DEFICIENCY IDENTIFICATION QUICK GUIDE
------------------------------------------
| Deficiency  | Visual Symptoms                          | Fix                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Nitrogen    | Yellowing from older leaves, tip to base | Urea/Ammonium Sulphate |
| Phosphorus  | Purple/red coloration on young leaves    | DAP / SSP              |
| Potassium   | Leaf edge scorch, weak stems             | MOP / SOP              |
| Zinc        | Interveinal chlorosis, brown spots       | ZnSO₄ 25 kg/ha         |
| Iron        | Interveinal yellowing on young leaves    | FeSO₄ spray 0.5%       |
| Boron       | Die-back of shoot tips                   | Borax 5 kg/ha          |
| Magnesium   | Interveinal chlorosis, older leaves      | MgSO₄ 25 kg/ha         |
| Manganese   | Grey speck (oats), marsh spot (peas)     | MnSO₄ foliar spray     |

7. FCO (FERTILIZER CONTROL ORDER) COMPLIANCE
----------------------------------------------
All fertilizers sold in India must conform to FCO, 1985 standards:
- Urea: minimum 46% N
- DAP: minimum 18% N + 46% P₂O₅
- MOP: minimum 60% K₂O
- SSP: minimum 16% P₂O₅
- NPK complexes: labelled N:P:K ratio guaranteed

Buy fertilizers only from licensed dealers with proper bills.
