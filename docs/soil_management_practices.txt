# Soil Management Best Practices (Source: ICAR Soil Health Mission)

## Rainfall Management
- After heavy rain (>30mm), delay fertilizer application 3-5 days.
- Allows soil to drain and prevents nutrient runoff.
- Nitrogen leaching is highest in sandy soils during heavy rain events.

## Irrigation Best Practices
- Over-irrigation reduces soil aeration, affects root health.
- Waterlogging can lead to nutrient lockup (especially iron, zinc).
- Drip irrigation improves water and nutrient efficiency by 30-40%.

## Organic Carbon Management
- Organic carbon improves water retention and nutrient availability.
- Crop residue incorporation increases OC by 0.02-0.05% annually.
- Balanced chemical + organic inputs (FYM) maintain soil health.

## Cost Considerations
- Over-fertilization = wasted money + soil damage.
- Soil testing every 2-3 years prevents blind application.
- Balanced nutrition reduces total fertilizer cost by 20-30% while maintaining yield.
